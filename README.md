# DDR_IR_UV_IF_Timecourses
5 point timecourses for IR and UV treatement, interrogating multiple siRNAs with 16 antibodies

2 microscopes used: Arrayscan and Opera Phenix
Analysis is slightly different for each of the two microscopes owing to different software used to call 'spots' and the different technology used to image the wells.

Full G1/G2 separation is complete in Arrayscan analysis, but not yet done for Phenix.
